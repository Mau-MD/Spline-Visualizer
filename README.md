# Spline-Visualizer
Spline generator and visualizer written in Java 

The program generates a series of cubic functions that meet some continuty criterias to make a smooth spline, based on a series of points. 
Then, based on a distance travelled, you can get the angle you should head in order to follow the spline correctly. 

This splines are custom made for our FTC Ultimate Goal Robot.
